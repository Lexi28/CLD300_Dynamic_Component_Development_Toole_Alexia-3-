        The Card component is a versatile UI element designed to display content
        in a visually appealing and interactive way. It supports a front and
        back view, allowing users to flip the card on click to reveal more
        detailed information. The component includes an image, a title, and a
        description on the front, with additional content on the back, making it
        suitable for showcasing products, services, or any other content
        requiring an engaging presentation. The cardâ€™s flip functionality is
        controlled through a simple click, toggling between the front and back
        views.
